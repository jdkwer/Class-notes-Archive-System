# Laravel Project Setup and Running Instructions

This project is built with the Laravel PHP framework. Below are the instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following software installed:

- **PHP** (version 8.0 or higher recommended)  
  [Download PHP](https://www.php.net/downloads)

- **Composer** (PHP dependency manager)  
  [Get Composer](https://getcomposer.org/download/)

- **Node.js and npm** (for frontend asset management)  
  [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- **Database** (MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, or SQLite)  
  Ensure you have a database server running and accessible.

## Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already)  
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd <repository-directory>
   ```

2. **Install PHP dependencies**  
   Run the following command to install all PHP packages required by Laravel:  
   ```bash
   composer install
   ```

3. **Install Node.js dependencies**  
   Run the following command to install frontend dependencies:  
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. **Set up environment variables**  
   Copy the example environment file and generate an application key:  
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   php artisan key:generate
   ```

5. **Configure your database**  
   Edit the `.env` file to set your database connection details:  
   ```
   DB_CONNECTION=mysql
   DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
   DB_PORT=3306
   DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
   DB_USERNAME=your_database_user
   DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
   ```

6. **Run database migrations**  
   This will create the necessary tables in your database:  
   ```bash
   php artisan migrate
   ```

7. **(Optional) Seed the database**  
   If your project includes seeders to populate initial data, run:  
   ```bash
   php artisan db:seed
   ```

8. **Build frontend assets**  
   For development, run:  
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```  
   For production build, run:  
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

9. **Run the development server**  
   Start the Laravel development server:  
   ```bash
   php artisan serve
   ```  
   By default, the server will be accessible at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

## Additional Notes

- If you make changes to frontend assets, remember to re-run `npm run dev` or `npm run build`.
- For more information on Laravel, visit the [official documentation](https://laravel.com/docs).
- Make sure your PHP installation has the required extensions enabled (e.g., OpenSSL, PDO, Mbstring, Tokenizer, XML, Ctype, JSON, BCMath).

## Troubleshooting

- If you encounter permission issues, ensure your storage and bootstrap/cache directories are writable.
- If migrations fail, verify your database credentials and that the database server is running.

This should help you get started with running the Laravel project locally.
